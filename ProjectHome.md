Kettle (a.k.a. Pentaho Data Integration) can use transformation and job definitions stored in file or in a database repository.

Objects in a database repository can be dumped to xml file, and objects in such a dump can be reimported into a repository. Through the UI, individual files can be stored in the repository or stored on file.

One missing link is exporting an entire repository to individual files.
